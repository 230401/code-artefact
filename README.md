# code-artefact
## Assignment 3 - data visualisation

**'data_l' file**: the data set used for the artefact.

**'code for a3.ipynb' file**: the code sequence.

The code sequence does not allow the bar chart races to be shown in that file. The bar chart races produced from the code can be viewed via the **'barchart1.mp4', 'barchart2.mp4' and 'barchart3.mp4' files.** These files show the bar chart races produced from the code during the editing, optimising and trial and error process. This process through code can be seen through the code sequence in the **'code for a3.ipynb' file.**

**Barchart1** showcases the bar chart race with default settings and no optimisations.
**Barchart2** demonstrates some optimisations with the number of bars shown on the graph, the colour palette used and duration of the visualisation.
**Barchart3** conveys more optimisations with colour palette, orientation, duration of the visualistion and number of bars. This bar chart was beginning to look how I wanted the artefact to appear, however slight changes needed to be made with the colour palette choice as there were duplicate colours appearing on the graph and the duration seemed slightly too quick.

**'artefact.mp4' file**: optimised and completed artefact. 
This finished artefact was optimised thorugh the colour palette used where no duplicate colours appeared on the graph making it more visually appealing. The opacity of the colours were changed and the duration was edited for a longer duration time.
